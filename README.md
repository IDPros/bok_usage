# IDPRO BODY OF KNOWLEDGE USAGE REPORTING

## Acquiring usage data

The geographic usage data is sourced from https://bok.idpro.org/manager/plugins/reporting/geo .

A monthly data series is created by exporting the report as a comman separated values file.

The file is encoded as UTF-8 and is stored in the data folder with the prefix `bok_geo_use_` and the suffix of the month as `yyyymm`.

For example `bok_geo_use_202211`.

Some countries, such as `CÃ´te d'Ivoire`, require unicode support.
